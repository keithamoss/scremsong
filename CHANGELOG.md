# v1.1 (DD-MM-YYYY)

Enhancements and bug fixes for the Federal Election.

## Triage

-   [Enhancement] A reviewer's current number of assignments now only includes their active assignments (not active + awaiting reply).
-   [Enhancement] The "Ignore" and "Dealt With" buttons now only display if the tweet isn't already assigned.
-   [Bug Fix] Fixed the mysterious bug where everyone ended up showing as offline
-   [Bug Fix] Links in tweets (e.g. to Facebook, Instagram) now open in a new tab.
-   [Bug Fix] Tweets with Videos/GIFs will now be displayed properly.
-   [Bug Fix] The issue with scrollin and seeing weird rendering issues on user mentions and hashtags is gone.

## Queue

-   [Enhancement] Simplified the workflow by removing the separate "Await Reply", "Close", and "Done" buttons. You now just need to "Close" an assignment and choose a reason (Awaiting Reply, Map Updated, No Change Required, Not Relevant).
-   [Enhancement] Your current number of assignments now only includes active assignments (not active + awaiting reply).
-   [Bug Fix] When you've cleared your queue the tab title will no longer show that you have one assignment left.
-   [Bug Fix] The "View on Twitter" button now links to the tweet you see on the assignment, not the original tweet that was assigned.
-   [Bug Fix] Replies from @DemSausage no longer cause assignments to reopen.
-   [Bug Fix] New and updated assignments now appear at the bottom of your queue so they don't interrupt what you're doing by scrolling the page.
-   [Bug Fix] The "Undo" notifications now close the assignment straightaway, not when they're removed from the screen.

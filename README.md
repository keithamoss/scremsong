## Development

[TypeScript-React-Starter](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter)

## Deploy

-   AWS S3 hosts the `Public` and `Admin` sites.
-   CloudFlare sits in front and handles caching and gives us HTTPS.
-   Travis CI handles automatic deploys from GitHub for us.
-   Duck CLI to ftp sync the legacy PHP API.

1.  S3 bucket setup for static website hosting, bucket policy set to public, and error document set to `index.html` to let React Router work.
    1.1 A second www.democracysausage.org bucket is setup to redirect requests to https://democracysausage.org
2.  CloudFlare just has default settings except for these Page Rules:
    2.2 api.democracysausage.org/\* Cache Level: Bypass
    2.3 democracysausage.org/static/\* Cache Level: Standard, Edge Cache TTL: A Month (Because S3 sends No Cache headers by default.)
    2.3 democracysausage.org/icons/\* Cache Level: Standard, Edge Cache TTL: A Month (Because S3 sends No Cache headers by default.)
3.  Travis CI setup with default settings to pull from `.travis.yml` with environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_DEFAULT_REGION, CF_ZONE_ID, CF_EMAIL, CF_API_KEY, FTP_USERNAME, FTP_PASSWORD, FTP_PATH, REACT_APP_MAPBOX_API_KEY_PROD
